# Network Journal - Implementation Progress Report

## Project Overview

The Network Journal is a personal intelligence system designed to map, understand, and leverage relationships within a personal network. It uses a graph-centric architecture with Neo4j, modular backend services, and a Svelte frontend to provide an interactive network visualization and AI-powered insights.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implemented

### System Architecture
- **Three-tier modular architecture**: Backend API, Graph Database Service, Frontend Client
- **Graph-native database**: Neo4j with Cypher query language
- **Microservices approach**: Independent development and deployment of components
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI-based backend with consistent response formats

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Neo4j, Pydantic
- **Database**: Neo4j AuraDB (managed graph database)
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, TypeScript, Vite
- **Testing**: pytest, TestClient
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## üìä Data Model Implemented

### Node Labels (Entities)
1. **Person**: Central entity with properties (name, email, phone, linkedin_url, etc.)
2. **Company**: Organizations with properties (name, industry, website)
3. **Interaction**: Communication events with properties (date, channel, summary)
4. **Topic**: Interests/skills with properties (name)
5. **Event**: Gatherings with properties (name, date, type)
6. **Location**: Geographical places with properties (city, state, country)

### Relationship Types
- `(:Person)-->(:Person)`: General connections (strength, type)
- `(:Person)-->(:Company)`: Employment relationships (role, dates)
- `(:Person)-->(:Interaction)`: Participation in interactions
- `(:Interaction)-->(:Topic)`: Topics discussed in interactions
- `(:Person)-->(:Topic)`: Direct interest relationships
- `(:Person)-->(:Event)`: Event attendance
- `(:Event)-->(:Location)`: Event location
