# Advanced AI System Architecture

## Overview

The Network Journal's AI system has been completely redesigned to address the critical issue of disconnected graph creation. The new system implements a **multi-stage AI approach** with context awareness, intelligent disambiguation, and relationship validation to ensure all new entities are properly integrated into the existing network structure.

## Problem Statement

The original AI system had several fundamental flaws:

1. **No Context Awareness**: The AI didn't know who the "main person" (Alice) was, leading to disconnected nodes
2. **No Disambiguation**: Couldn't handle ambiguous names like "John" when multiple Johns exist
3. **No Relationship Validation**: Created isolated nodes without checking existing connections
4. **No Ambiguity Resolution**: Didn't prompt for clarification when needed
5. **Rigid Relationship Types**: Couldn't handle new relationship types dynamically

## Solution Architecture

### Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline

The new system uses a sophisticated 4-stage pipeline:

```
Stage 1: Entity & Relationship Extraction
    ↓
Stage 2: Ambiguous Entity Resolution
    ↓
Stage 3: Relationship Validation
    ↓
Stage 4: Graph Entity Creation
```

### Stage 1: Entity & Relationship Extraction

**Purpose**: Extract all entities and relationships from unstructured text with context awareness.

**Key Features**:
- **Context Awareness**: Understands that "I met X" means Alice met X
- **Perspective Understanding**: Distinguishes between "X met Y" and "I met X"
- **Entity Classification**: Identifies people, companies, topics, events, and locations
- **Relationship Detection**: Finds all relationships between entities

**Example Processing**:
```
Input: "I met John at the conference. He works at Google and is interested in AI."
Output: 
- Entities: John (person), conference (event), Google (company), AI (topic)
- Relationships: Alice met John, John works at Google, John interested in AI
```

### Stage 2: Ambiguous Entity Resolution

**Purpose**: Resolve ambiguous entity references by checking existing data and using AI disambiguation.

**Resolution Strategies**:

1. **Exact Match**: Direct name lookup in database
2. **Fuzzy Search**: Find similar names using partial matching
3. **AI Disambiguation**: Use LLM to choose between multiple candidates
4. **Context Analysis**: Consider surrounding context for disambiguation

**Disambiguation Actions**:
- `create_new`: Create a new entity (no good match exists)
- `use_existing`: Use an existing entity (clear match found)
- `ask_user`: Request user clarification (multiple good matches)

**Example Disambiguation**:
```
Input: "John" (ambiguous)
Candidates: 
- John Smith (Google, Software Engineer)
- John Doe (Microsoft, Product Manager)
Context: "works at Google"
Decision: use_existing (John Smith)
```

### Stage 3: Relationship Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure all relationships connect to valid entities and maintain graph integrity.

**Validation Checks**:
- Both entities exist or will be created
- Relationship types are valid
- No circular references
- Proper relationship direction

### Stage 4: Graph Entity Creation

**Purpose**: Create entities and relationships in the graph database with proper integration.

**Creation Process**:
1. Create new entities first
2. Update resolution with new IDs
3. Create relationships between entities
4. Link to existing entities where appropriate

## Key Components

### AdvancedNoteProcessorService

The core service that orchestrates the entire pipeline:

```python
class AdvancedNoteProcessorService:
    def __init__(self, main_person_name: str = "Alice"):
        self.main_person_name = main_person_name
        self.main_person_id = None
        # Initialize LLM chains for extraction and disambiguation
```

**Key Methods**:
- `process_note_advanced()`: Main processing pipeline
- `_resolve_ambiguous_entities()`: Entity disambiguation
- `_validate_relationships()`: Relationship validation
- `_create_graph_entities()`: Graph creation

### Entity Disambiguation System

Sophisticated disambiguation using multiple strategies:

```python
async def _resolve_person_entity(self, entity: EntityMention, note_text: str):
    # 1. Try exact name match
    existing_person = get_person_by_name(entity.name)
    if existing_person:
        return {"action": "use_existing", "entity": entity, "existing_id": existing_person.id}
    
    # 2. Search for similar names
    similar_people = search_people(entity.name)
    
    # 3. Use AI disambiguation for multiple candidates
    if len(similar_people) > 1:
        disambiguation = await self.disambiguation_chain.ainvoke({...})
        return disambiguation_result
```

### Context-Aware Prompting

The AI prompts are designed to understand context and perspective:

```
IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- The main person in this network is "Alice"
- When someone says "I met X", it means Alice met X
- When someone says "X met Y", it means X and Y have a relationship
- Always consider the context and perspective of Alice
```

## API Endpoints

### New Advanced Endpoints

1. **`POST /api/v1/ai/process-note-advanced`**
   - Main endpoint for advanced note processing
   - Supports context awareness and disambiguation

2. **`POST /api/v1/ai/test-extraction`**
   - Test extraction without creating entities
   - Useful for debugging and validation

3. **`GET /api/v1/ai/disambiguation/{entity_name}`**
   - Get disambiguation suggestions for entities
   - Helps resolve ambiguous references

### Request/Response Models

```python
class AdvancedNoteProcessingRequest(BaseModel):
    note_text: str
    main_person_name: str = "Alice"
    main_person_id: Optional[str] = None
    auto_create_entities: bool = True

class AdvancedNoteProcessingResponse(BaseModel):
    analysis: Dict[str, Any]  # Complete analysis
    resolved_entities: Dict[str, Any]  # After disambiguation
    validated_relationships: list  # Validated relationships
    created_entities: Dict[str, Any]  # Created in graph
    main_person_id: Optional[str]
    processing_confidence: float
```

## Handling Complex Relationships

### Dynamic Relationship Types

The system can handle new relationship types that haven't been predefined:

```python
# Example: Mentorship relationship
if rel["relationship_type"] == "MENTORS":
    # Create custom relationship
    create_custom_relationship(
        rel["from_id"], 
        rel["to_id"], 
        "MENTORS",
        rel.get("properties", {})
    )
```

### Relationship Properties

Relationships can have rich properties:

```python
{
    "from_entity": "Sarah",
    "to_entity": "Mike",
    "relationship_type": "MENTORS",
    "strength": 4,
    "properties": {
        "start_date": "2024-01-01",
        "focus_area": "Product Management",
        "frequency": "weekly"
    }
}
```

## Error Handling and Validation

### Robust Error Handling

1. **LLM Failures**: Graceful fallback when AI processing fails
2. **Database Errors**: Transaction rollback on entity creation failures
3. **Validation Errors**: Clear error messages for invalid data
4. **Disambiguation Failures**: Fallback to user prompts

### Validation Checks

1. **Entity Validation**: Ensure entities have required properties
2. **Relationship Validation**: Verify relationship integrity
